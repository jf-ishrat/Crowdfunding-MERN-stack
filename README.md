# Crowdfunding 

This is a fund-raising project for the people who needs to collect funds for various purposes. This is a donation-based web platform where a person can create a

any reward from the campaign-creator.

## Project details
At first user needs to sign up to our web platform except guest user. Campaign creators need to fill the forms with required informations for creating a campaign.
Every campaign will have a fixed duration and a goal amount. Backers can back the campaign within the fixed duration. All registered users will have a profile. They can view their
created and backed campaigns. Campaign's progress will be shown by a progressbar that indicates how much money has been raised. Every campaign will have a story section
that provides the details of that campaign,
a FAQ section that provides the frquently asked questions of that campaign, a comment section where registered users can comment and a Backers list section that shows

All campaigns will be organized according to their category. We have 3 main categories. They are Teck & Innovation, Creative works and Community projects. Users
can explore the campaigns according to these categories. Also we provide a tag-based search option by which user can search for a campaign according to their tags.
